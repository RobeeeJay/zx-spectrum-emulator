//! The +3's disk controller: a µPD765A, as far as +3DOS can tell.
//!
//! The chip is driven through two ports — a status register the program polls
//! and a data register it pushes bytes at — and every command is the same
//! three phases: the program writes a command and its parameters, then the
//! data goes one way or the other, then the program reads the result bytes
//! back. What is here is that state machine and the commands +3DOS uses.
//!
//! Nothing is timed. A real controller makes the program wait while the head
//! steps and the disk turns, and reports "not ready" until the motor is up to
//! speed; this one answers at once. +3DOS polls rather than counting, so it
//! cannot tell — but a program that measures the wait could, and that is worth
//! knowing before trusting this with a protected disk.
