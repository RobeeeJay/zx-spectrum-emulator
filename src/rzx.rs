//! RZX recordings: a snapshot, then every byte the machine read from a port,
//! frame by frame, for as long as somebody played.
//!
//! Playing one back is not emulating input — it is replacing it. The machine
//! runs the number of instructions the recording says, and every IN gives back
//! the byte that was read at that point when the recording was made, so the
//! program takes exactly the path it took then. That is why a recording is
//! worth having for reading a program: it is a run of the real thing, with the
//! keyboard and the loading and the copy protection already dealt with.
//!
//! The format is a header, then blocks: `$10` says who made it, `$30` carries
//! the snapshot to start from, `$80` carries the frames. Both of the last two
//! are usually deflated.
