//! Loading a tape by answering the ROM instead of playing it.
//!
//! A tape normally loads at 1,500 baud whatever the emulator does about it:
//! the deck makes pulses, the ROM's loader counts them, and four minutes of
//! tape takes four minutes of machine time however fast the machine is run.
//! Running the CPU flat out shortens the wait; it cannot remove it.
//!
//! This removes it. When the machine calls the ROM's LD-BYTES with a standard
//! block under the head, the block is handed over whole — copied into memory,
//! the registers left as the routine would have left them — and the return is
//! taken there and then. A tape loads in the time it takes to memcpy it.
//!
//! It only works where the ROM is doing the loading. A game with a loader of
//! its own is reading the port itself and counting its own pulses, and nothing
//! here can help it: those still load at whatever speed the machine is being
//! run at, which is what Max Speed is for.
