//! ZX81, in 1K and 16K forms.
//!
//! The ZX81 has no video hardware worth the name: the picture is produced by
//! the CPU walking the display file, with the ULA watching the bus. Whenever an
//! opcode is fetched from an address with A15 set and bit 6 clear, the ULA feeds
//! the CPU a NOP instead and uses the byte it saw as a character code, fetching
//! that character's bitmap from the ROM during the refresh half of the same M1
//! cycle and shifting it out as eight pixels.
//!
//! Emulating it at that level — rather than drawing a character grid — is what
//! makes it cycle exact, and is why programs that abuse the mechanism for
//! high-resolution graphics work without any special handling.
