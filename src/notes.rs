//! Labels and comments the user writes against addresses while disassembling.
//!
//! They are kept in a plain text file beside whatever is being disassembled —
//! the tape if one is in the deck, otherwise the ROM — so a listing built up
//! over an evening is still there next time, and can be read, edited or diffed
//! without the emulator. One line per address:
//!
//! ```text
//! # ZX-Rustrum notes
//! 8000 start      ; wait for the frame to finish
//! 8003            ; the border is set here
//! 800A @clear_screen_800A ; @Fills the display file with one value
//! ```
//!
//! An `@` marks something AutoDoc worked out rather than something the user
//! wrote. The distinction is what lets a later, better guess replace an
//! earlier one while never touching a line somebody typed themselves.
