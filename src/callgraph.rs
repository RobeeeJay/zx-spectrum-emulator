//! Arranging a call graph so it can be looked at.
//!
//! The observer knows who called whom and how often. That is a graph, and a
//! graph drawn as it comes — nodes wherever they happen to fall — is a ball of
//! wool. This puts it in layers: a routine sits one layer to the right of
//! whatever called it, so the picture reads left to right the way the calls
//! went, and within a layer the routines are ordered to keep the lines between
//! them as untangled as the arithmetic can manage.
//!
//! It is the standard way of drawing this — layer, then order, then place —
//! done in as little code as the job needs and no crate.
