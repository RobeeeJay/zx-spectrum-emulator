# The emulator as an MCP server

`cargo run --release --bin mcp` speaks [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)
over stdin and stdout: JSON-RPC 2.0, one message a line. It is the emulator
without a window — the same `Spectrum`, the same observer, the same
disassembler — driven by a program rather than by a person.

What it is for is taking a game apart: load it, run it under control, watch
what it does, and write down what has been worked out.

```jsonc
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{}}
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/list"}
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":3,"method":"tools/call",
 "params":{"name":"load_tape","arguments":{"path":"tapes/Jetpac.tzx"}}}
```

Every reply is text. The thing reading it is a language model, and a table it
can quote back is worth more than a structure it has to re-serialise.

## The tools

**Getting a machine going.** `machine_info`, `set_machine`, `reset`,
`load_tape`, `load_snapshot`, `load_recording`, `play_recording`.

`load_tape` types `LOAD ""` and runs the tape to its end with the ROM loader
handed over, so a four-minute tape loads in a second or two of real time; pass
`autoload: false` to put it in the deck without starting it. `load_snapshot` is
quicker still and starts in the middle of a game, which is usually where the
interesting code is.

**The map, before disassembling.** `memory_activity`, `tape_blocks`, `loader`.

**The +3's drive.** `mount_disk`, `new_disk`, `eject_disk`, `disk_info`,
`disk_speed`, `disk_catalogue`, `read_sector`, `disk_activity`. `mount_disk` takes a `.dsk` or a `.zip` with one inside. A disk is
mounted read-only unless asked otherwise, and a writable mount says where the
writes go — `copy_to` writes the image to a new file first, and is the only way
to write a disk that came out of an archive. `read_sector` reads
the image rather than driving the drive, so it works whatever the machine is
doing. See [`disks.md`](disks.md).

`memory_activity` is the access map: reads, writes and whether anything ran
there, per 256-byte page, with a guess at what each page is for and whether a
back buffer has been detected. `tape_blocks` decodes the headers — what loads
where — which is the memory map before there is one.

**Running it.** `step` (with `over` for stepping over a `CALL`), `run_frames`,
`run_tstates`, `run_until`, `watch_events`.

`run_until` is the breakpoint, and `watch_events`'s `write_to` is the
watchpoint: stop at whatever writes to an address, which — once
`changed_since` has found the address — is how the code behind a variable is
found. `watch_events` is the more useful one for
finding your way around a program nobody has documented: it stops on *what the
program did* rather than on where it is — a write to the display file, the
beeper or the sound chip being touched, the frame interrupt, a call into the
ROM, any `IN`, any `OUT`. Switch on `screen` and run, and the machine stops at
the instruction that drew something.

**Looking at it.** `screen`, `graphics`.

`screen` sends a PNG in an image block — a model with eyes sees the picture —
along with a sketch of the 32x24 character cells and what the attributes are
set to, for one that cannot. `graphics` reads memory as characters and sprites,
eight bytes each, which is how graphics are found: point it at a candidate
address and see whether letters, a sprite or rubbish comes out.

**Typing at it.** `press_keys`, `type_text`, and `mouse` for whichever mouse is
fitted — moves in the machine's pixels, buttons, then a few frames. For an AMX
mouse the movement is queued as steps that its PIO delivers as interrupts,
once the program has turned them on.

**The printer.** `printout` gives what a fitted ZX Printer or Alphacom 32 has
printed: the paper as a PNG, a pixel a dot, and any text on it read back
through the font CHARS points at, as Fuse reads it.

The ROM scans the keyboard once a frame and wants a key on two scans running
before it believes in it, so a key is held for ten frames by default. Several
keys at once is a chord: `["CAPS SHIFT", "1"]`. This is how a game is driven to
the level worth looking at, and how the input routine is found — press
something and see who reads port $FE.

**Reading it.** `registers`, `read_memory`, `write_memory`, `disassemble`,
`load_symbols`, `symbols`, `identify`.

`load_symbols` reads the symbol files for the machine out of the preferences
directory — `tools/rom-symbols.py` and `tools/skool-symbols.py` write them —
and builds the table of routines recognisable by their first twelve bytes.
After it, `disassemble` names the address a `CALL` names, and `identify` will
tell you that the code a game copied to $9000 is the ROM's own CLS. A name
typed with `set_comment` always wins over one from a file.

Addresses may be numbers or strings: `32768`, `"$8000"`, `"0x8000"`, `"8000h"`.
A bare string of digits is decimal, deliberately — reading decimal addresses as
hex is how `tools/skool-symbols.py` once found nothing at all and said so
quietly.

`write_memory` pokes the running machine and nothing else; it is for testing a
theory (freeze the counter and see what stops moving), not for patching a file.

**Watching it.** `watch_routines`, then `routines`, `routine`, `call_graph`,
`code_map`, `xrefs`, `blocks`, `profile`, `frame_timing`, `autodoc`.

`xrefs` answers "what refers to this address" two ways at once, and labels
which is which: what the machine was *watched* doing is fact, and what the
*code* says is a search whose hits include data that happens to look like an
instruction.

The observer attributes every write, read, port access and loop to the routine
on top of the call stack, worked out from what the CPU did rather than by
decoding opcodes. Nothing is counted until `watch_routines` switches it on, and
the tools say so rather than answering with an empty table that reads like an
answer. It costs a branch on every access, so switch it off when finished.

**Searching it.** `find_bytes`, `changed_since`.

The variable hunt: `save_state`, lose a life, `changed_since` — the counter is
among the handful of addresses that come back. The display file is left out
unless asked for, since it changes every frame and would bury the answer.

**Hearing it.** `sound_state`.

The beeper bit of port $FE, and on a 128K the AY's registers with what they
mean channel by channel — tone, noise, volume, period turned into a pitch.
`watch_events` with `beeper` or `ay` finds the routine doing it.

**Keeping it.** `save_state`, `restore_state` — by name in the session, or as a
`.sna` file. An experiment that goes wrong is undone by putting the machine
back.

**Writing it down.** `set_comment`, `comments`, `save_comments`,
`export_listing`.

`export_listing` writes the whole annotated disassembly to a file — the thing
being built. What ran while watching is disassembled; what did not is left as
bytes rather than turned into instructions nobody executed. Notes go to
`<name>.zxrs.txt` beside the tape or snapshot: plain text, one line an address,
readable and diffable without the emulator. A guess made by AutoDoc is marked
as a guess and never overwrites something typed.

## Things worth knowing

**A machine with no ROM looks like a game that crashed.** A fresh `Spectrum`
has `$FF` where the ROM should be, which is `RST $38` forty thousand times
over: it runs, it fills the screen with rubbish, and it sits at `$0038`. The
session tracks whether a real ROM has been put in rather than looking at the
bytes, because "not all zeros" is true of an empty machine. Every game
"loaded" against that and ran for thousands of frames of nothing, and the
report said so cheerfully — which is what the end-to-end test against a real
tape was written to catch.

**The observer needs calls to watch.** An edge in the call graph is a call made
from inside something. Code entered by a jump has no frame for a call to come
from, so a main loop that was never itself called is not a routine and its
calls are attributed to whatever is under it.

**Where in the frame a routine ran decides what is seen.** The ULA draws
between T-state 14,336 and 57,344 on a 48K. A write above the beam is on the
screen this frame; one below it waits for the next. `run_tstates` is how to
stop part-way through a frame and look.

**A recording is played by fetch count.** A frame of an RZX is a number of
opcode fetches, and the interrupt comes at the recording's own frame boundary
rather than on the T-state clock. `play_recording` does that; see
[`timing.md`](timing.md).

**There is no JSON crate in the lock file**, and none can be added, so
`src/mcp/json.rs` is a small implementation of exactly what JSON-RPC uses —
the same bargain as `src/svg.rs`.

## Driving the machine's own commands

A Spectrum's keywords are one key each rather than words to spell out, so
`type_text` reads a line the way the machine would have it typed: `LOAD` is the
L key, `CAT` is extended mode with a shift on the 9, and the symbols are behind
SYMBOL SHIFT. That is the only way to reach the extended-mode words at all, and
it is what makes `LOAD *"m";1;"prog"` and `FORMAT "m";1;"cart"` typable. Text
inside quotes is typed letter by letter, since a file called `"info"` is not
`IN` followed by `fo`. A line starts with a keyword, and a letter asked for at
the start of a line is an error rather than a keyword nobody wanted: the mode
is read out of FLAGS at $5C3B rather than guessed.

## What is not exposed

Still in the emulator and not offered here:

- Race the Beam (`race.rs`) — replaying a frame instruction by instruction to
  watch the picture being built, and the tints that say which side of the beam
  a write landed on;
- the timeline (`timeline.rs`) — a turn of the loop drawn against the frames it
  ran in, which `frame_timing` answers a flatter version of;
- the CRT and composite rendering (`crt.rs`), since what a model needs from the
  screen is what is on it rather than what a television did to it;
- the ZX81's tape deck;
- the RZX playback's visited-address set.

The ZX81 answers the tools that mean something on it — loading a `.p`,
running, registers, memory, disassembly, the screen and the notes. The rest say
what they are about and how to get back to a Spectrum, rather than reporting
zeros: an empty answer reads like a finding.
